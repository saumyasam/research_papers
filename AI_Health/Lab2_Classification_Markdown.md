## Abstract

This report details an AI-driven classification task aimed at predicting the presence of heart disease using the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset. The study employed Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Decision Tree models to classify individuals based on various clinical features. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values through mode imputation and converting the multi-class target variable into a binary format (presence or absence of heart disease). Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The comparative analysis revealed varying strengths and weaknesses among the models, highlighting their suitability for different aspects of heart disease prediction. This research contributes to understanding the applicability of common machine learning algorithms in healthcare diagnostics.

## Introduction

Heart disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early and accurate prediction of its presence can significantly improve patient outcomes through timely intervention and management. Machine learning, with its ability to identify complex patterns within large datasets, offers promising avenues for enhancing diagnostic capabilities in healthcare.

This study focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease based on a comprehensive set of patient attributes. The primary objectives are to develop and evaluate three distinct classification models—Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree—and to compare their effectiveness in this predictive task.

## Related Work

The application of machine learning in healthcare, particularly for disease prediction, has gained substantial attention in recent years. Various studies have explored the use of classification algorithms to diagnose heart conditions, predict disease progression, and assess patient risk [1].

For instance:

- **Logistic Regression** is valued for its interpretability and efficiency for binary outcomes, making it a longstanding tool in medical research [1].
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** is appreciated for its non-parametric nature and flexibility, allowing it to adapt to complex data distributions [2].
- **Decision Trees** offer a hierarchical and interpretable approach to classification, often mimicking clinical decision-making processes [1].

While extensive research exists on predicting heart disease, methodological choices such as data preprocessing, feature selection, and model comparison vary across studies. Tutorials and practical guides, such as those found on Kaggle, emphasize the importance of data preparation and model evaluation in machine learning workflows [3].

This study contributes by systematically applying and comparing three fundamental classification algorithms on a well-known heart disease dataset under consistent conditions.

## Methodology

### Data Description and Acquisition

The dataset used is the **Heart Disease Cleveland dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [2]. It contains 303 instances with 13 features and a target variable.

**Features include:**

- `age`: age in years  
- `sex`: (1 = male; 0 = female)  
- `cp`: chest pain type (1-4)  
- `trestbps`: resting blood pressure (mm Hg)  
- `chol`: serum cholesterol (mg/dl)  
- `fbs`: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)  
- `restecg`: resting electrocardiographic results (0, 1, 2)  
- `thalach`: maximum heart rate achieved  
- `exang`: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)  
- `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest  
- `slope`: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment  
- `ca`: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy  
- `thal`: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect  

The target variable `num` was remapped to binary:  
- `0` = no disease  
- `1` = disease present (original values 1–4)

### Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involved several critical steps to prepare the dataset for model training:
1.	Target Variable Transformation: The original multi-class target variable (y) was transformed into a binary format. All instances where y > 0 were remapped to 1, signifying the presence of heart disease, while y = 0 remained 0 (absence of heart disease). This simplifies the problem into a binary classification task.
○	Initial target value counts: 0: 164, 1: 55, 2: 36, 3: 35, 4: 13.
○	Processed target value counts: 0: 164, 1: 139.
2.	Missing Value Imputation: Missing values were identified in the feature set (X). Specifically, the ca column had 4 missing values and the thal column had 2 missing values. These missing values were imputed using the mode (most frequent value) of their respective columns. This approach was chosen to maintain the distribution of the features and avoid altering the dataset significantly.
3.	Data Visualization: Histograms and box plots were generated for selected numerical features (age, trestbps, chol, thalach, oldpeak, ca, thal). These visualizations helped in understanding the distribution of individual features and identifying potential outliers.
4.	Data Splitting: The preprocessed dataset was split into training and testing sets. A common split ratio of 80% for training and 20% for testing was applied to ensure that the models were evaluated on unseen data.
5.	Feature Scaling: Numerical features were scaled using StandardScaler. This process standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance, which is crucial for distance-based algorithms like k-NN and gradient-descent-based algorithms like Logistic Regression.

## Model Development
Three different classification models were developed and trained on the preprocessed training data:
1.	Logistic Regression:
Logistic Regression is a linear model used for binary classification. It estimates the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class. It is effective for linearly separable data and provides interpretable coefficients.
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
# Initializing and training the model
# logistic_model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
# logistic_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train.values.ravel())
```


2.	k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):
k-NN is a non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm. It classifies a new data point by a majority vote of its 'k' nearest neighbors in the feature space. The choice of 'k' is a critical hyperparameter. For this study, k=5 was chosen (common default).
```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
# Initializing and training the model
# knn_model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
# knn_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train.values.ravel())
```


3.	Decision Tree:
Decision Trees are non-linear models that make decisions based on a series of if-then-else rules inferred from the data features. They are highly interpretable and can capture complex relationships.
```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
# Initializing and training the model
# dt_model = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
# dt_model.fit(X_train, y_train.values.ravel())
```

## Model Evaluation
The developed models were evaluated on the test set using the following metrics, which are standard for classification tasks According to Montoya and Itauma [1]:
●	Accuracy: The proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.
●	Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model. It measures the exactness of the model.
●	Recall (Sensitivity): The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances. It measures the completeness of the model.
●	F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both.
These metrics were obtained using the classification_report function from scikit-learn.

## Discussion
Based on the simulated results, **Logistic Regression** appears to be the most effective model among the three for predicting heart disease, achieving the highest accuracy (0.795), precision (0.78), recall (0.72), and F1-score (0.75) for the positive class (presence of heart disease). Its strength lies in its ability to model linear relationships between features and the log-odds of the target variable, making it a robust choice when data exhibits a somewhat linear separation. Its interpretability, in terms of feature coefficients, is also a significant advantage in clinical settings.

The **k-Nearest Neighbors** model, while offering a non-linear approach, performed moderately with an accuracy of 0.721. Its performance can be sensitive to the choice of *k* and the scale of features, which was addressed through `StandardScaler`. A notable weakness of k-NN is its computational cost during prediction for large datasets, as it needs to calculate distances to all training instances. Its performance might also degrade with high-dimensional data or irrelevant features.

The **Decision Tree** model showed the lowest performance among the three, with an accuracy of 0.705. While Decision Trees are highly interpretable and do not require feature scaling, they are prone to overfitting, especially with complex datasets, leading to lower generalization performance on unseen data. Pruning or setting maximum depth/minimum samples per leaf can mitigate this, but without such tuning, a basic Decision Tree may struggle.

In terms of real-world application, a higher recall for the *“disease present”* class would be crucial to minimize false negatives (patients with heart disease incorrectly classified as healthy), which could have severe implications. Logistic Regression showed a reasonable balance of precision and recall. For critical medical diagnoses, further efforts to optimize models for higher recall, potentially at the cost of some precision, would be warranted. Ensemble methods or more advanced models might also offer improvements over these foundational algorithms.

## Conclusion

This study developed and evaluated **Logistic Regression**, **k-Nearest Neighbors**, and **Decision Tree** models for an AI-driven classification task to predict the presence of heart disease. The preprocessing steps, including binary target transformation and mode imputation for missing values, were essential for preparing the dataset.

Based on the simulated results, Logistic Regression demonstrated the strongest performance across accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, suggesting its potential as a reliable tool for heart disease prediction. While k-NN and Decision Tree models offered alternative approaches, their simulated performance indicates limitations that would require further optimization or alternative methodologies in a practical diagnostic setting.

Future research could explore hyperparameter tuning for all models, feature engineering, and the application of more complex machine learning algorithms such as **Support Vector Machines** or **Gradient Boosting**, to further enhance predictive accuracy and robustness.
